# Python-Camper-Sort
During the time I worked at a summer camp Vermont, one of the tasks that took up a significant amount of time was dividing the campers, counselors, and directors into groups to accomplish the cooking, table service, and dishes for each day. This was especially difficult because we wanted to give everyone an opportunity to try different types of services, and also work alongside different people.

I created a python program that sorts students into different groups. Additionally, it uses plotly to visualize the schedule.
